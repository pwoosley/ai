## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Exercise 1 (Sequence)
- ❌ Not using enough variables (need 5+)
- ❌ Forgetting to calculate a final total
- ❌ Missing print statements
- ❌ No comments explaining steps

### Exercise 2 (Selection)
- ❌ Only using `if` without `elif` or `else`
- ❌ Wrong comparison operators (using `>` instead of `>=`)
- ❌ Missing the additional condition requirement
- ❌ Not printing both grade and message
- ❌ Incorrect grade boundaries

### Exercise 3 (Iteration)
- ❌ Loop runs too few times (<10)
- ❌ Forgetting to increment counter in while loop (infinite loop!)
- ❌ Not printing inside the loop
- ❌ Poor output formatting
- ❌ Missing loop control variable

## Example Scoring Scenario

**Student: Alex Smith**

| Exercise/Category | Points Earned | Max Points | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Exercise 1: Sequence | 22 | 25 | Missing one calculation; good comments |
| Exercise 2: Selection | 28 | 30 | Excellent logic; could improve one condition |
| Exercise 3: Iteration | 27 | 30 | Loop works well; formatting could be better |
| Code Quality | 8 | 10 | Good naming; some inconsistent spacing |
| Creativity & Effort | 4 | 5 | Added input validation - nice touch! |
| **TOTAL** | **89** | **100** | **Grade: B (89%)** |

**Feedback:** Great work, Alex! Your code demonstrates solid understanding of all three control structures. To earn an A, focus on: (1) adding one more calculation to Exercise 1, (2) refining your additional condition in Exercise 2, and (3) improving output formatting in Exercise 3. Your input validation in Exercise 2 was excellent!
